#CurrVit 
A simle, elegant CV/Resum√© template with backbone integration. 

CurrVit is designed to be cross-browser, cross-device friendly CV template that has an elegant default style that looks equally good when printed.

**At the moment it isn't.**

###Goals of CurrVit 

- Contains your contact details in [Microformats][1] format.
- Elegant Print stylesheet
- Clean, Semantic DOM. 
- Simple, sublte, understated design.


###Future of CurrVit
This is just a side project of a side project so I'll be working sporadically on it. If you like the idea, and what to help me take it further then fork away.

If you decide to use this template then give me a shout, via [twitter][2] is probably best.
